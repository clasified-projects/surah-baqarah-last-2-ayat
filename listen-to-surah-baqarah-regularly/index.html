                        <p><strong>Surah Baqarah</strong> is the longest Surah of the Quran, containing
                            profound spiritual as well as universal lessons. It was narrated that the Prophet (peace and
                            blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “Whoever says it in the morning has done so for the
                            rest of the day, and whoever says it in the evening has done so for the rest of the day”
                            (al-Tirmidhi, 3388). For many people, the problem is not understanding how exciting noise
                            can sound, but how to construct a regimen of listening to it regularly.

                        <p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) advised us to be in close contact with Surah Baqarah. It is
                            stated as a “protection from Shaytan” in a hadith (Sahih Muslim).</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="tips">
                        <h2 class="heading">Practical Tips to Listen Regularly</h2>
                        <h3 class="bold">Set a Fixed Time Daily</h3>
                        <p class="side-gap">The easiest way to develop a Surah Baqarah routine is to set aside a specific time every day.
                            For many people, the best time is early morning or late afternoon. Listening directly
                            following Fajr prayer, for example, allows you to begin the day with clarity and calm.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Use Reliable Audio Sources</h3>
                        <p class="side-gap">There are top-quality recitations by popular Qur’an reciters on apps such as Quran.com,
                            Muslim Pro, or YouTube. Selecting one single reader prevents your mind from having to adjust
                            to new rhythms and gets you in the flow much more easily.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Break It Into Sections</h3>
                        <p class="side-gap">Surah Fatiha is comparatively much shorter and takes less than 5 minutes, and considering the
                            Baqarah is 286 verses long, it could potentially take up to one hour. Divide it into parts
                            if you feel overwhelmed by listening to the entire Surah. For example, hear 50 verses in the
                            morning and another 50 at night, and keep going. This enables you to get through the Surah
                            in a couple of days without any pressure.”</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Combine Listening With Daily Tasks</h3>
                        <p class="side-gap">You don’t have to always have to be sitting still. Countless others listen in their cars,
                            while cooking, on their daily commutes. Turning these into listening moments can help you
                            stay caught up without requiring extra time in your day.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Pair Listening With Understanding</h3>
                        <p class="side-gap">Hearing it is powerful, but doing so without understanding isn’t as effective as hearing it
                            with translation or tafsir. Or even 10 minutes exploring the full meaning of the ayats you
                            heard can have a relationship-building effect.</p>

                        <h3 class="bold">Build Consistency Over Perfection</h3>
                        <p class="side-gap">A day will be missed now and then, but the routine you’re establishing is more important than
                            perfection. Begin with three times per week and work up. Slowly, the habit of listening to
                            Surah Baqarah will become a part of your life.</p>

                        <h3 class="heading">Reflection</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Prophet, peace be upon him, noted Surah Baqarah carries blessings and acts as
                            protection. Setting up a routine helps. Using trusted audio sources makes it easier to stick
                            with. Pairing it with everyday tasks like, folding laundry or commuting works well too. The
                            thing is, consistency turns it into a habit that actually sticks around. Try to understand
                            the meanings and live your life according to its teachings. May Allah make it easy for us to
                            listen to Surah Baqarah regularly and benefit from its blessings. Ameen.

                        <p>All the<strong> Quranic</strong> Surahs are of great importantance with good (Khair) in them.
                            However,
                            some Surahs and their ayats have special benefits and virtues that we know some of, while
                            <strong>Allah</strong> the wise knows them all. The last 2 ayat of Surah Baqarah are also
                            special among
                            all of them.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this short article, we will cover the importance of Surah Baqarah's last two Ayat in light
                            of Hadiths. Before moving towards the hadiths, it's important to understand the meaning of
                            these final
                            two ayats.</p>

                                one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) "We make

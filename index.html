        <p>Surah Baqarah last 2 ayats are some of the Quran's most important and spiritually significant ayats.
          These
          2 ayats are located in the second surah of the Quran, Al-Baqarah(The Cow), starting from the ayat number 285
          to 286, they are rich with meaning, guidance, and comfort for believers. The surah tells us the history of
          the previous ummahs, their attitude towards Islam, and their messengers.</p>
        <p>The ayats highlight the importance of faith in Allah, His angels, His books, His
          messengers, and the obedience of believers. These are the core principles of Islam that a person who claims
          to be a Muslim must adhere to. Memorization and recitation of these 2 ayats are highly encouraged due to
          their significance and are said to offer defense against whispering, witchcraft, and evil eyes.</p>

          <h2 class="heading">The Revelation of the Surah Baqarah Last 2 Ayats</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The revelation of the last two ayats of Surah Baqarah has a unique story, as the Muslims are told and
          fascinated about the significant moment known as the Night Journey(Isra' and Mi'raj). It was a miraculous
          event, the Prophet (ﷺ) was taken from Mecca to Jerusalem and ascended to the heavens. Throughout the whole
          journey, the Prophet (ﷺ) was given three gifts from Allah, those are:</p>

        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>The five daily prayers, an obligation on the believer(at a certain age).</li>
            <li>The last two ayats of Surah Al-Baqarah.</li>
            <li>It was promised to him (ﷺ) that the sins of those who do not associate anything with
              Allah would be forgiven.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Unlike most of the Quran that was sent down at Muhammad (ﷺ) on Earth, the last two ayats of Surah
          Baqarah were revealed to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) from under the throne of Allah, from the divine treasure while
          traveling towards the Heavens. These two ayats were written by Allah on Loh-e-Mahfooz, 2000 years before he
          even created the Heavens and the Earth.</p>

        <div id="significance">
          <h2 class="heading">Significance of the Last 2 Ayats</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>The significance of the last 2 ayats of Surah Baqarah is reported in various hadiths, in
              Sahih Muslim, hadith no.780, it is narrated by Abu Huraira (RA), The Messenger (ﷺ) of Allah said:
              'Do not turn your houses into graves. Indeed, Shaytan does not enter the house where Surah Baqarah is
              recited.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <img class="images" src="./images/sahih_muslim_hadith_no.780.webp" alt="Sahih Muslim 780">

        <p>Although this hadith is about the entire Surah Al-Baqarah, the last two verses are often singled out for
          their particular power in warding off evil and protecting from harmful forces.</p>
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>According to Sahih Muslim Book 04, hadith no.1760, Ibn Abbas narrated that the Prophet
              Muhammad (ﷺ) was sitting with Jibrael, a gate of Heaven opened that was never opened before and an angel
              descended through it who never came down to the earth before. The angel greeted and said, Rejoice
              in two lights given to you which have not been given to any prophet before youOne of the lights
              was the last 2 ayats or the concluding ayats of Surah Baqarah.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The recitation of these ayats is a self-reminder of the <strong>Islamic Core</strong> beliefs that are also
          the key pillar of faith and a way to asses one's attitude compared to the believers described in the
          last ayat 285. The ayat 286 serves as a supplication for asking Allah's mercy, forgiveness, and relief
          from burdens.</p>
        <div id="benefits">
          <h2 class="heading">Surah Baqarah Last 2 Ayats Benefits</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Aside from good deeds one gets on reciting the Al-Quran, Surah Baqarah's last 2 Ayats are recited for other
          purposes. The meaning of the ayats is also of a dua, there are several reported hadiths of Prophet Muhammad
          (ﷺ) encouraging the recitation of the last 2 ayats of Surah Baqarah for various purposes and
          situations.</p>
        <h4>Protection from Harm and Evil:</h4>
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>Reciting the last two verses of Surah Baqarah acts as a shield against harm, Shaytan
              (Satan), and other evil powers. The Prophet (ﷺ) highlighted the protective power of these ayats in
              multiple hadiths.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h5>Reference:</h5>
        <p>"Shaytan does not enter a house in which Surah Al-Baqarah is recited." (Sahih Muslim, Hadith 780)</p>
        <p>By reciting these ayats, believers can guard their homes and families from the negative influence of evil
          and
          satanic forces, which ensures spiritual protection and peace.</p>

        <h4>Sufficiency and Security:</h4>
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <li>The last two ayats are enough for a believer in terms of protection, comfort, and
              security. To fulfill the needs of those who recite them. The Prophet (ﷺ) encouraged us to recite them,
              especially at night.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h5>Reference:</h5>
        <p>"Whoever recites the last two verses of Surah Al-Baqarah at night, they will suffice him." (Sahih Bukhari,
          Hadith 5009; Sahih Muslim, Hadith 807)</p>
        <p>This applies to those who recite the last two ayats before sleeping. However, there are two interpretations
          of this hadith, the first one is that the recitation of these ayats will suffice for any need of other azkar
          and night prayer, and the other one is that it is sufficient to protect the believer from evil.</p>
        <h4>Forgiveness of Sins:</h4>
        <p>The last 2 ayats of Surah Baqarah are a source of divine forgiveness and mercy. The translation of the
          second
          ayat contains a beautiful dua for asking forgiveness from Allah.</p>
        <div class="blog-list">
          <ul>
            <em>
              <li>Our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord! Do not place
                a burden on us like the one you placed on those before us. Our Lord! Do not burden us with what we
                cannot bear. Pardon us, forgive us, and have mercy on us. You are our ˹only˺ Guardian. So grant us
                victory over the disbelieving people.
            </em>(Al-Quran, Surah Baqarah, Ayat 286)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The recitation of these ayats with sincerity is a means of asking for and obtaining Allah's
          forgiveness, especially for unintentional mistakes or sins that are overlooked.</p>
        <h4>Strengthening of Faith:</h4>
        <p>The most important and powerful aspect of reciting and pondering the Al-Quran is strengthening one's
          faith. The last 2 ayats affirm the believer's commitment to Allah, His messengers, and His divine
          revelation. These verses also reaffirm the Muslim faith in the unseen and guidance from Allah. These ayats
          are a strong reminder of Islamic core beliefs.</p>
        <h4>Relief from Hardship and Burdens:</h4>
        <p>One of the key benefits of reciting the last 2 ayats of Surah Baqarah is the relief from hardships and
          burdens and a source of comfort. While reciting the believers ask Allah not to place such a burden on them
          that they can not bear. By making this dua, Muslims seek Allah's assistance in overcoming challenges
          and trust that He will not test them beyond their capacity.</p>

        <p>
          Quran was revealed in Arabic and is spoken in the Middle East, North Africa, and some areas of the Horn of
          Africa. Although the Quran's Arabic is not straightforward, the richness and depth of the language
          often make it challenging to convey the full spectrum of its meanings in English. So, to understand the
          meaning of Surah Baqarah's last 2 ayats, one of the most common English translations and a summarized
          version of Tafseer Ibn Kaseer is added below.

        <h5>
          Tafseer:
        </h5>
        <p>
          In the first ayat, Allah emphasizes the core beliefs of the believers in Islam. All the believers believe
          Allah is the One and Only, and the Sustainer. No one is worthy of worship except Him and no Lord except Him.
          They proclaim their faith in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers without distinguishing between
          them such as believing in some of them and rejecting others. </p>
        <p>
          They also believe in all prophets and messengers sent by Allah, considering them truthful and righteous.
          Although some prophets introduced laws that replaced previous ones by Allah's will, the final law given to
          Muhammad (ﷺ), the last prophet, abrogated all earlier laws. Muhammad's (ﷺ) law will remain valid until
          the Day of Judgment, with a group of his followers always steadfast in the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last part of this ayat reflects the attitude of submission and obedience to Allah. The believers
          acknowledge Allah's commandments, they understand and act upon them. They seek forgiveness for their
          deeds and rely on the mercy and kindness of Allah. They acknowledge the fact that everyone will ultimately
          return to Allah.

          Tafseer:
        </h5>
        <p>
          The last ayat of the second ayat of our discussion reminds us of Allah's absolute kindness, justice,
          forgiveness, blessing, and mercy. The ayat reassures believers that they will not be tested or asked for a
          burden they can not handle. This shows that although Allah will question his servants and judge them, He
          will only punish for what one can protect himself.</p>
        <p>
          As for what one can not protect himself from, the servant is exempted from the punishment. He gets a reward
          for that which he has earned, of good, and gets punished for that he has earned, of evil, and as we
          discussed earlier, concerning the acts he is responsible for. Furthermore, the believer seeks forgiveness
          from his lord for the acts for which he might have forgotten the obligation(such as prayer) or fallen into
          sin without knowing.</p>
        <p>
          The act of making dua from the calamities that befall the early people, meaning the Christians and Jews. The
          believer asks Allah not to reveal his sins or expose them that is between him and his Lord. In the last
          dialogue, the believer asks for Allah's mercy as he is the supporter, sustainer, and helper. For we
          know to Allah we all shall return, and we ask Him to give us victory over the disbelieving people.</p>
